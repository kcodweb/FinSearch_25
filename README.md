USE DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (RL) TO OPTIMISE STOCK TRADING STRATEGY AND THUS MAXIMISE INVESTMENT RETURN
## Application - Inverted Pendulum 
The inverted pendulum is a classic control systems problem often used in the reinforcement learning community to demonstrate balance and control using continuous action spaces.
Goal: Keep the pendulum upright by controlling the movement of a cart along a one-dimensional track.
State Space: A vector representing the angle of the pendulum and its angular velocity (continuous)
Action Space: Apply a continuous force (torque) to the cart's base to swing left or right.
Reward Function: Designed to reward the agent when the pendulum is near upright and penalize large deviations or excessive control effort.
